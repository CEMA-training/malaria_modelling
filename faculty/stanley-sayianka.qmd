I am an aspiring research scientist with a strong foundation in statistical methods. I am currently specializing in epidemiology and quantitative finance. I am fascinated by how learning algorithms adapt and evolve, particularly in response to the complexities of the real world. My interests include machine learning and probabilistic (Bayesian) reasoning, and I am dedicated to integrating my studies with practical experiences to drive impactful results.
