Thumbi Mwangi is an infectious disease epidemiologist combining classical epidemiology, applied epidemiological modelling and data science to improve the speed and quality of policy decision making in human and animal health. His research program conducts population-based studies, statistical and mathematical tools to understand the epidemiology, optimize surveillance and control of zoonotic diseases.

His current research includes:
- implementation research for the elimination of dog-mediated human rabies
- optimal use and placement of primary healthcare services
- improvement of essential health services
- syndromic surveillance for early detection of zoonotic spillover
- transmission and control of animal and human brucellosis
- livestock interventions for improvement of human nutritional status
