    "text": "Background\nThe Center for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (CEMA) at the University of Nairobi, in collaboration with the Swiss Tropical And Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) is hosting a specialized training course on mathematical modelling of infectious diseases, focusing on Malaria. It will be a two-week event that will host participants from malaria-endemic African countries and is open to researchers and health science professionals with quantitative backgrounds in mathematics, statistics, epidemiology, and data science. The course will cover infectious disease modelling theory, specifically malaria, and provide hands-on experience with R programming and model simulations. Participants will apply their learning through guided projects applicable to their specific areas of interest in mathematical modelling of malaria."

What components were effective/could be improved for knowledge translation?\n\nKey Themes:\n\nFocused Problem Statements: Clear and concise problems made the tools practical.\nLonger Working Time: Extended durations were suggested for deeper exploration and refinement.\nPre-event Planning: Early provision of datasets and structured pre-hackathon planning were beneficial (but could have been even earlier!).\n\nSupporting Quotes:\n\n“Focused problem statements streamline efforts and lead to more impactful outcomes.” — Anonymous\n“In the future, it could be helpful to have more time for testing and refining the final solutions. This will allow the participants to see the project through to a higher level of innovation.” — John Ojal\n“Plan and work pre-hackathon to help with working plans and structure.” — Peter Waweru Mugo\n“Receiving datasets ahead of time might have helped a little.” — Anonymous"
